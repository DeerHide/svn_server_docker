### svnserve.conf — main server config for svn:// protocol
### Security-first defaults: no anonymous access, logged, authz enabled.

[general]

# Who can do anything before auth?
#   none  = anonymous users have no access
#   read  = anonymous can read (not recommended for private repos)
anon-access = none

# What level do authenticated users get by default?
#   read  = read-only
#   write = read/write
# Keep this conservative; grant broader rights via [authz] instead.
auth-access = read

# Realm is the "credential namespace" shown to clients.
# Changing it will make clients prompt again for creds.
realm = Deerhide SVN Docker

# Where to read user/passwords if using the built-in db.
# Relative paths are resolved relative to THIS FILE’s directory.
password-db = passwd

# Enable path-based authorization. Strongly recommended.
# Use a shared file (e.g., /etc/svn/authz) if multiple repos share rules.
authz-db = authz

# Enforce case style for usernames (helps avoid duplicates like 'Alice' vs 'alice').
# Options: upper | lower | none
force-username-case = lower

# Optional: simplify admin by storing a single set of credentials for multiple repos.
# Uncomment if you use a shared passwd file:
# password-db = /etc/svn/passwd

# Optional: point at shared authz file:
# authz-db = /etc/svn/authz

# Logging (server-side). Ensure the path is writable by the svnserve user.
# For containerized setups, log to a mounted volume for persistence.
# log-file = /var/log/svn/svnserve.log
# log-level = info    # debug | info | warn | error

# If you plan to use SASL (kerberos, ldap via sasl, etc.), enable it here
# and configure /etc/sasl2/svn.conf. If you’re happy with passwd, leave off.
# use-sasl = true


[sasl]
# Only relevant if use-sasl = true above.
# min-encryption = 128
# max-encryption = 256
